## About

This repository contains my project work for Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/nd101).

## Projects

- **Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns:** a ANN(Artificial Neural Netwrok) to predict bike-sharing patterns.
- **Dog-Breed Classifier:** a CNN(convolutional neural networks) to classify the breed of dog
- **Generate TV Scripts:** generate TV scripts using RNN(recurrent neural networks)
- **Generate Faces:** generate realistic faces using GAN(generative adversarial networks)
- **Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model:** a web-app that uses the deployed neural network model which predicts the sentiment of a              user-provided movie review.
